Other code by:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Haeleth
- Wrote the original libReallive (rlvm is built on top of it)
- Wrote the kprl/rlc toolchain; used to compile the test cases
- Wrote several features

Kazunori "jagarl" Ueno
- Wrote file decoders for the majority of formats that RealLive and AVG32 use,
  which I have blatantly stolen, as they had BSDish licenses.
- Wrote the EF00 DLL emulation for Little Busters, which I have adapted for use
  in rlvm.

Rasqual Twilight
- Provided Win32 build files and several small bugfixes

Special thanks to Jagarl for the first work on reverse engineering the RealLive
interpreter and for Free software licensed source code for decoding their file
formats, to Richard 23 for figuring out features added to RealLive for Little
Busters, to \\{jyuichi} for help with Kud Wafter, and to Haeleth for creating
rldev, along with answering all my dumb questions about the internal workings of
the RealLive system.
