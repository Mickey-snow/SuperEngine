rlvm is now at the point where enough commands are implemented that
other games *may* work. The above is only a list of what I've tested
first hand or what I've been told.

rlvm has an implementation of rlBabel; English patches compiled with
Haeleth's rlBabel should line break correctly. I've successfully tested
it with the Kanon patch from NDT.

rlvm supports KOE, NWK and OVK archives for voices, along with ogg
vorbis voice patches which follow the convention
<packnumber>/z<packnumber><sampleid>.ogg.

Fullscreen can be entered by pressing Alt+{F,Enter} on Linux and
Command+{F,Enter} on Mac.

## USING RLVM

If you are using Ubuntu or OSX, rlvm makes an effort to find a system
Japanese Gothic font. If rlvm is complaining that it can't find a font,
it will also look for the file "msgothic.ttc" in either the game
directory nor your home directory. If you are using Linux, you can
manually specify a font with the --font option.

    $ rlvm [/path/to/GameDirectory/]

The rlvm binary should be self contained and movable anywhere. To install rlvm,
go into the build directory and run:

	$ sudo make install

If you don't have the file "msgothic.ttc" in either the game directory
nor your home directory, please specify a Japanese font on the command
line with --font.

## COMPILING RLVM

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following libraries and utilities installed:

- **CMake** (version 3.18 or higher):
  [https://cmake.org/](https://cmake.org/)
- **Boost** (version 1.40 or higher):
  [https://www.boost.org/](https://www.boost.org/)
- **SDL 1.2**:
  [https://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php](https://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php)
- **OpenGL** and **GLEW**.
- **FreeType**:
  [https://www.freetype.org/](https://www.freetype.org/)
- **GNU gettext**
- **zlib**
- **vorbisfile** (part of the Ogg Vorbis audio codec):
  [https://xiph.org/vorbis/](https://xiph.org/vorbis/)

### Obtaining the Source Code

Clone the RLVM repository and initialize its submodules:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mickey-snow/SuperEngine.git rlvm
cd rlvm
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Configuring and Building RLVM

Use CMake to configure and build the project:

1. **Configure the Build**

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G "<generator>" [options]
```

2. **Build the Project**

```bash
cmake --build build
```

### Running RLVM

After a successful build, you can run RLVM using the following command:

```bash
./build/rlvm
```

*Note:* RLVM runs without icons or localization support by default.

### Building and Running Unit Tests

To run unit tests, additional dependencies are required:

- **GoogleTest** and **GoogleMock**
- **Python 3** with the following packages: `numpy`, `wave`, `soundfile`

1. **Configure the Build with Tests Enabled**

   ```bash
   cmake -S . -B build -DRLVM_BUILD_TESTS=ON
   ```

2. **Build the Project**

   ```bash
   cmake --build build
   ```

3. **Run the Unit Tests**

   ```bash
   ./build/unittest
   ```

All tests should pass successfully.


## KNOWN ISSUES

- **Clannad Side Stories**: The game runs, but due to incomplete opcode support,
  several issues remain:
  - Missing sound effects.
  - Menu may not work.

  It is advised to delete `~/.rlvm/KEY_HIKARI_SAKA_STEAM_EN` before first running
  the game in newer versions of rlvm.

- **Little Busters' Baseball Minigame**: This minigame doesn't function because
  it relies on a Windows DLL, which rlvm does not support. Similarly, the
  **dungeon crawling minigame** in *Tomoyo After* is also affected for the same
  reason.

- **Steam Edition of Little Busters**: The asset files in this version are
  packed into `.PAK` archives, which rlvm currently cannot recognize. As a
  result, this edition of the game is not supported.
